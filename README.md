## Using iOS shortcut (contributed by @JohnMcAnearney)
You can use the iOS shortcut found here: [Embed in Discord](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3412a4c344fd4c6f99924e525dd3c0a2), in order to quickly embed content using InstaFix. The shortcut works by grabbing the url of the Instagram content you're trying to share, automatically appends 'dd' to where it needs to be, copies this to your device's clipboard and opens Discord. 

Note: Once you've downloaded the shortcut, you will need to: 
1. Update the value of YOUR_SERVER_URL_HERE by opening the shortcut in the Shortcuts App. The value for this can be a direct message URL or a server URL.
2. The shortcut will already be available in your share sheet. To test, go to Instagram -> share -> Tap on "Embed in Discord".
3. This will open Discord and now you simply paste the text into the custom chat you've setup!
4. Now edit your sharesheet to make it even quicker to use! Simply open your share sheet by sharing something from Instagram, click "Edit Actions..." and click the "+" button on "Embed in Discord"
